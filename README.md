# React

React is a library not a framework by Facebook engineer in 2013 and open source in 2015

In React , there is a concept of *Virtual DOM and what we use with HTML is real DOM*

Problem with real DOM : Whenever we make changes, it refreshes the entire page unnecessarily. We only need to update the specific part that was modified.

**Virtual DOM**

- **Concept:** abstraction of actual DOM.
- **Purpose:** Boosts performance by minimizing real DOM manipulation.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces unnecessary re-rendering, updates only specific changes
- **Example Scenario:** User interaction triggers changes, updating only affected parts, like the Instagram feed. The rest of the app remains unchanged.
